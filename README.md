    I'm Adrian Miguel, a Systems, Games, and Digital Art Developer, as well as the leader and founder of the Sharpgear group.
    I work in different areas of development, with skills in Front-end, Back-end, and Game Development, a field in which I have extensive self-taught experience.
    Since I was young, I've had a strong interest in programming -- I started by creating small mods, and over time, I evolved into developing my own original games, which I continue to actively work on to this day.
